# uber-usage-visualization

This reposity contains supporting code which was used to create a heat map of Uber usage in New York.

We took advantage of the Google Maps API to draw polygons around each of New York's [NTA boundaries](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NTA-map/d3qk-pfyz/data). The polygons were then coloured with a gradient based on the uber usage in the region. More red means more usage, more yellow means less usage.
